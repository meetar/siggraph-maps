# siggraph-maps

Three maps to [illustrate a Mapzen blog post](https://mapzen.com/blog/scenes-from-a-siggraph), interpreting a very short week in downtown Los Angeles.

This video-game style uses a few old-school tricks including dithered binary alphas to fake partial opacity and blended sprites. The shadows are duplicate copies of the geometry, stretched out and over neighboring geometry. Super fake.

####1988

Don't let nostalgia cloud your thinking – this was what the 80's looked like, especially towards the end. Simple geometric patterns, and just teal and burgundy everywhere. Throw some Garamond on here and it's basically the carpet in an early Apple manual.

When I added the lavender, no fooling, I got the creeps. Too real.

####Galaxy

A nod to more recent tropes, when reflections, glows, and sparkles suggested the innocence of the past mirrored in our collective – yeah I don't know, design was full of starfields for awhile, at least I didn't name this style Chillwave.
